# Extension Icons

You need to create three PNG icon files with the following specifications:

## Required Files:
- **icon16.png** - 16x16 pixels (for browser toolbar)
- **icon48.png** - 48x48 pixels (for extension management page)
- **icon128.png** - 128x128 pixels (for Chrome Web Store)

## Design Requirements:
- Music note symbol with border
- Transparent background
- Clear, recognizable at small sizes
- Consistent design across all sizes

## Quick Creation Options:
1. **Use online icon generators** like favicon.io or canva.com
2. **Extract from your current web app** - take screenshots of the MusicIcon component
3. **Use AI image generators** with prompt: "music note icon with border, transparent background, simple design"

## Temporary Solution:
For testing, you can use any PNG files with the correct names and sizes. The extension will work without perfect icons.
